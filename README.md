<p>Landslide and Rain data were determined two be two of the biggest factors contributing to landslides in Italy</p>
<ul>
    <li>KNN model used to predict rainfall scale in 'KNNrain.ipynb' and result outputed to 'Rainfall.txt'
    <li>SVM model used to predict landslide magnitude in 'SVMlandslide.ipynb' and result outputed to 'Landslide.txt'
    <li>Results of 'Rainfall.txt' and 'Landslide.txt' used to predict chance of major landslide event occuring in 'FinalCal.ipynb'
</ul>
